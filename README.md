This project is a part of the [FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/). It involves building a tribute page to honor someone who inspires or interests me. The goal of the project is to practice foundational HTML and CSS skills, create a well-structured webpage, and ensure the page is responsive across different devices.

- **Responsive Design:** The page is fully responsive, meaning it works well across different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
- **CSS Styling:** Custom CSS is used to style the page, ensuring that the design aligns with the tribute theme.
- **Image and Content Alignment:** The tribute page includes an image of the person being honored, as well as a brief bio with important milestones in their life.

## Tech Stack

## User Stories

The project meets the following user stories:

1. **User Story #1**: I can view a tribute page with an image and text.
2. **User Story #2**: I can see a title with the subject's name or title.
3. **User Story #3**: I can see an image within the tribute page.
4. **User Story #4**: The image has a corresponding alt text that describes it.
5. **User Story #5**: I can see a link that points to more information about the subject.

## Development Process

1. **Planning**: I first chose an inspiring figure to honor in the tribute page and outlined the key content I wanted to include (e.g., biography, image, achievements).
2. **HTML Structure**: Next, I structured the page using HTML5 elements like `<header>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` to logically organize content.
3. **CSS Styling**: Finally, I applied custom CSS to achieve the desired layout, typography, and colors that fit the tribute's theme.
4. **Responsive Design**: I used media queries to ensure the page looks great on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
